  <h1>The Solution </h1>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p> The main issues identified in my data anylsis of men in Sydney are the disconnect and the isolation of educated, wealthy men from the rest of the population. These men are mainly found in Sydney's CBD, Lower North Shore, and Eastern Suburbs. This leaves large areas of Sydney without any of these men. Therefore, the main aims of my solution are to connect and spread these men with the rest of Sydney.

  <h2>The Men-o-Rail</h2>
      <p> My solution for this problem is to create a method of connecting areas with less eligible men to areas with more. The obvious answer is to build a large monorail system, which I have called the "Men-o-rail" connecting various areas on both the North and South of Sydney. This will connect a variety of areas to ensure an even spread of eligible bachelors. The stations located in these areas will also have cafes and recreational spaces where single people can hang out and mingle.

      Above displays the location of the monorail and its stations. The rail will start at Manly and moves through Vaucluse, Bondi, Maroubra, Kensington, Surry Hills, Sydney's CBD, St Leonards, Chatswood, Gordon, Macquarie Park, Ryde, Sydney Olympic Park, Strathfield, Bankstown, Chester Hill, Parramatta, Baulkham Hills and Castle Hill. As you can see from the image below, the rail (in blue) runs through areas with varying proportions of eligible males. This ensures that there is an even spread of men across Sydney.
