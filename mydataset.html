  <h1> Sydney's Eligible Bachelors </h1>

  <p> Where are Sydney’s most eligible bachelors located? <br> 
Using Census data and visualisations the location of intelligent, wealthy and available men between the ages of 25 and 34 can be found. 
  </p>
    
  <h2>Education</h2>
        <p> Using the 2016 ABS data set "Level of Education by Age by Sex," this map shows the proportion of males between the ages of 25-34 with a bachelor degree. Unsurprisingly, there are large numbers of educated males near Macquarie University, Sydney University, The University of Technology Sydney, and The University of New South Wales. Further, there are large proportions of educated males in Paramatta, Rockdale, Wolli Creek, Mascot, Newtown, Surry Hills and the CBD. This may be due to the fact that there are more males of that age group living in those areas. The majority of these educated males are located in the South of Sydney and the latte line (in red) can be seen just above Mosman to Hornsby. </p>

<p> On the right, you can see the proportion of males between 25 and 34 with a bachelor degree and on the left you can see the proportion of males within the same age range in each area. As you can see, areas with high proportions of educated males also have high levels of males in the age range. Thus, those areas above the latte line are not necessarily lacking educated males, they are likely lacking young men.</p>

 <h2> Income </h2>
        <p>Once again on the left we have the proportion of males with a bachelor degree and on the right the males earning more than $2000 a week (within the age range) can be visualized using the 2016 ABS dataset, “Total Personal Income (Weekly) by Age by Sex.” This comparison clearly shows the concentration of wealthy and educated men on the Lower North Shore, Inner West, Eastern Suburbs, and the CBD. </p>

<h2>Available</h2>
        <p>On the left we can see the proportion of males with bachelor’s degrees and on the right shows the males which are not married from the 2016 ABS dataset “Social Marital Status by Age by Sex.” The greatest proportions of single men are located in the South of Sydney, mainly concentrated in the CBD, Surry Hills, the Eastern Suburbs and Paramatta.</p>
