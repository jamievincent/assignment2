  <h1> Sydney's Eligible Bachelors </h1>

  <p> Using my dataset, overlaid with others, I aim to discover where Sydney's most eligible bachelors are located. The three key criteria include age range, education, income and availability. I will be looking at men between the ages of 25 and 34. I will also be looking at the proportion of men who have completed a bachelor degree and a weekly income over $2000. Finally I will check that these men are not married. 
  </p>
    
  <h2>Education</h2>
        <p> Using the 2016 ABS data set "Level of Education by Age by Sex," this map shows the proportion of males between the ages of 25-34 with a bachelor degree. On the map below, the lighter, yellow shades represent a higher proportion of educated males and the darker colours represent a lower proportion. From this visualisation, it is very clear that there are more educated males located in the north shore, the CBD and surrounding suburbs. The proportion smoothly lowers as you move away from these areas, towards the west and more rural areas.

 <h2> Income </h2>
        <p> Now let's compare these results to the proportion of wealthy men in Sydney. For this I'm going to be using the 2016 ABS dataset, “Total Personal Income (Weekly) by Age by Sex.” On the left is the proportion of males with a bachelor degree and on the right is the proportion of males with a weekly income of more than $2000. We can see a similar concentration in the Lower North Shore, the CBD and surrounding suburbs. However, the contrast between these areas and the surrounding areas is a lot harsher. This likely means that there are higher paying jobs and more job opportunities for graduates in these areas. Thus, from this comparison I beleive that gradutes are moving to these areas to get a job and earn more money.

<h2>Available</h2>
        <p> Finally, let's check that these intelligent and wealthy men are available. For this I will be using the 2016 ABS dataset “Social Marital Status by Age by Sex.” On the left is the proportion of males with bachelor's degrees and on the right displays the men who are not married. Surprisingly there is quite an even spread of single men in Sydney. However, the Lower North Shore has significantly less single men that the rest of Sydney. 

        On the left we can see the proportion of males with bachelor’s degrees and on the right shows the males which are not married from  The greatest proportions of single men are located in the South of Sydney, mainly concentrated in the CBD, Surry Hills, the Eastern Suburbs and Paramatta.</p>
