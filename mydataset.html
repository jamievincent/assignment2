  <h1> Sydney's Eligible Bachelors </h1>

  <p> Where are Sydney’s most eligible bachelors located? <br> 
Using Census data and visualisations the location of intelligent, wealthy and available men between the ages of 25 and 34 can be found. 
  </p>
    
  <h2>Education</h2>
        <p> Using the 2016 ABS data set "Level of Education by Age by Sex," this map shows the proportion of males between the ages of 25-34 with a bachelor degree.

 <h2> Income </h2>
        <p>Once again on the left we have the proportion of males with a bachelor degree and on the right the males earning more than $2000 a week (within the age range) can be visualized using the 2016 ABS dataset, “Total Personal Income (Weekly) by Age by Sex.” This comparison clearly shows the concentration of wealthy and educated men on the Lower North Shore, Inner West, Eastern Suburbs, and the CBD.

<h2>Available</h2>
        <p>On the left we can see the proportion of males with bachelor’s degrees and on the right shows the males which are not married from the 2016 ABS dataset “Social Marital Status by Age by Sex.” The greatest proportions of single men are located in the South of Sydney, mainly concentrated in the CBD, Surry Hills, the Eastern Suburbs and Paramatta.</p>
