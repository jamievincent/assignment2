  <h1> Sydney's Eligible Bachelors </h1>

  <h2> Mesh Blocks </h2>
  <p> Mesh Blocks are the smallest geographical areas which are defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The shape of the mesh blocks are created taking into account to administrative boundaries, suburbs, local government areas, land use and dwelling distribution. These mesh blocks are updated every 5 years and cover the whole of Australia with no gaps or overlaps. (ANZLIC, 2018). From these mesh blocks, Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1) are built to create geographical areas. There are 57,523 SA1 regions covering Australia with an average population size of around 400 people. (ABS, 2016).

  <h2>Data Journalism</h2>
        <p> Data journalism is simply journalism done with data. It is the process of collecting and visualising data to present a story. As stated in the Data Journalism Handbook, "Data can be the source of data journalism, or it can be the tool with which the story is told, or it can be both" (Bradshaw, 2018). This form of journalism has become increasingly popular because it enables a more engaging and accurate story. In this article, the author used techniques of data journalism to visualize the gender pay gap in various areas of the UK.

<p> On the right, you can see the proportion of males between 25 and 34 with a bachelor degree and on the left you can see the proportion of males within the same age range in each area. As you can see, areas with high proportions of educated males also have high levels of males in the age range. Thus, those areas above the latte line are not necessarily lacking educated males, they are likely lacking young men.</p>

 <h2> Income </h2>
        <p>Once again on the left we have the proportion of males with a bachelor degree and on the right the males earning more than $2000 a week (within the age range) can be visualized using the 2016 ABS dataset, “Total Personal Income (Weekly) by Age by Sex.” This comparison clearly shows the concentration of wealthy and educated men on the Lower North Shore, Inner West, Eastern Suburbs, and the CBD. </p>

<h2>Available</h2>
        <p>On the left we can see the proportion of males with bachelor’s degrees and on the right shows the males which are not married from the 2016 ABS dataset “Social Marital Status by Age by Sex.” The greatest proportions of single men are located in the South of Sydney, mainly concentrated in the CBD, Surry Hills, the Eastern Suburbs and Paramatta.</p>
