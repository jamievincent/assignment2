  <h2> Mesh Blocks </h2>
    <p> Mesh Blocks are the smallest geographical areas which are defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The shape of the mesh blocks are created taking into account to administrative boundaries, suburbs, local government areas, land use and dwelling distribution. These mesh blocks are updated every 5 years and cover the whole of Australia with no gaps or overlaps. (ANZLIC, 2018). From these mesh blocks, Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1) are built to create geographical areas. There are 57,523 SA1 regions covering Australia with an average population size of around 400 people. (ABS, 2016).

  <h2>Data Journalism</h2>
    <p> Data journalism is simply journalism done with data. It is the process of collecting and visualising data to present a story. As stated in the Data Journalism Handbook, "Data can be the source of data journalism, or it can be the tool with which the story is told, or it can be both" (Bradshaw, 2018). This form of journalism has become increasingly popular because it enables a more engaging and accurate story for the reader. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html">This</a> article by The New York Times, called "Trump's Lies" was shortlisted in the 2018 Data Journalism Awards. The article compliles every lie Donald Trump told in 2017 and visulaises the data on a number of graphs and tables to fully convey their intented message. Thus, the article effectively uses data journalism to portray a compelling story.

  <h2> My Dataset </h2>
    <p> In my investigation I will be using the 2016 ABS data set "Level of Education by Age by Sex," which outlines the number of males and females which have completed certain levels of tertiary education. I will be using this dataset to discover where the most educated men are located. This dataset could further be used to see where more graduate level jobs and affordable housing are needed. Additionally, the dataset could be used to see where new schools and universities are needed if graduates are looking to further their education or start a family.
